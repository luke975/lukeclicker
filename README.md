Luke Clicker

A clicker game made by me as a test.

The Original version is the most known, but the Luke Clicker person (me) is working on a Command Line edition

Because I am better at coding command line applications, it will be more feature rich than the original!

All of the CMD edition's code will be in this github repository. Its a simple C# application.
